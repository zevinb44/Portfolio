# Protfolio
This repository contains projects I have worked on during my academic life and personal life.
Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you will find a curated collection of my past projects from both my academic and personal endeavors as a data scientist. Each project reflects my passion for leveraging data-driven insights to tackle complex challenges and drive meaningful impact.

 - **Knowledge Management Graph Database:**
 In this project, I designed and developed a knowledge management system using a graph database. By representing relationships between various entities, such as concepts, documents, and authors, I created an intuitive platform that facilitated efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery.

Predicting NBA Wins:
Using advanced statistical modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms, I built a predictive model to forecast NBA team wins based on various factors such as player performance, team statistics, and game dynamics. This project enabled me to demonstrate my ability to extract valuable insights from complex sports data and apply them in a practical setting.

U.S Phrase-To-Phrase Matching:
By analyzing a vast corpus of text data, I developed a phrase-to-phrase matching algorithm specifically tailored to the nuances of the English language. This project allowed me to explore natural language processing techniques and build an efficient and accurate system for identifying and extracting meaningful associations between phrases.

Wastewater Treatment Plant Upgrade:
Working in collaboration with an engineering team, I contributed to a project focused on optimizing the efficiency and sustainability of a wastewater treatment plant. By analyzing historical data, identifying key operational bottlenecks, and implementing data-driven recommendations, we were able to significantly enhance the plant's performance and reduce environmental impact.

Weigh-In-Motion Stations:
In this project, I developed a data analytics solution for weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations, which are used to monitor vehicle weights on highways. By processing and analyzing real-time data from these stations, I designed an automated system that detected anomalies and identified potential overloading issues, contributing to improved road safety and maintenance.

These projects highlight my expertise in various domains of data science, including database management, predictive modeling, natural language processing, and industrial optimization. Through my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate the breadth of my skills and the value I can bring to diverse data-driven challenges. I invite you to explore each project in detail and witness the tangible outcomes achieved through rigorous analysis, innovative methodologies, and a keen eye for extracting actionable insights.
