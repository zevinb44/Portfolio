# Protfolio
This repository contains projects I have worked on during my academic life and personal life.
Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you will find a curated collection of my past projects from both my academic and personal endeavors as a data scientist. Each project reflects my passion for leveraging data-driven insights to tackle complex challenges and drive meaningful impact.

 - **Knowledge Management Graph Database:**
 
George Mason University (GMU) is one of only 146 institutions in the United States that is classified as an R1 University: a university recognized as one with very high research activity. To maintain R1 University status, finding relevant research partners within GMU for research projects, proposals, and grants efficiently is of utmost importance. Currently, GMU is lacking a tool that is able to find current research partners with up-to-date relevant experience. Two researchers at the University of Pittsburghaddressed a similar problem and developed knowledge graphs to help students connect with potential research advisors. A readily available database containing faculty member subject expertise and conducted research would significantly reduce the time researchers spend looking for research partners. This project consists of four steps: data collection, natural language processing, data storage, and visualization/reporting. Data cleaning is completed using self-built web scrapers. Natural language processing uses cosine similarity to compare concepts of research areas to the biographies and abstracts of papers published by faculty members. Data storage uses graph databases powered by Neo4j. Finally, visualizations/reporting use NeoDash to create dashboards to display data from the database. Our team created a graph database prototype that connects faculty members to prospective research categories and areas and connects their published material to potential research subjects. We discovered that the stated research interests of faculty members are a much more reliable source of information, and the relationships developed using cosine similarity provide a less accurate option for potential research experts. The solution provides rudimentary search capabilities looking for collaborators; however, it is currently limited by data made available online. We believe it has the potential to grow into an important tool in GMU’s desire to continue being one of the country’s top research institutions.


- **Predicting NBA Wins:**

The number one objective of any sports team is to win games and this fact holds true in the NBA. In the past teams would often rely on the “eye-test” to determine whether a factor like adding a player, changing an offensive scheme, or focusing on a different aspect of the game would lead to more wins. This process is based solely on feeling and personal biases and is often unreliable. 
Utilizing the techniques taught in OR 568 on NBA game statistics, various models will be trained to determine which game statistics, both basic and advanced, lead to a win and then these models will be used to predict which team would win in the future based on game stats.
There are two research questions that this analysis will explore. The primary question is related to the performance of the classifier: Can a model be built to predict which team will win? Additionally, through further analysis of classifier performance, the key input variables will be examined and a determination of which statistics most affect a team’s chances to win.

- **U.S Phrase-To-Phrase Matching:**

The motivation behind this problem stems from the nature of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s work. Every time a patent is submitted it undergoes a vigorous examination process to determine whether an application meets the requirements of a claimed invention, the scope of that claim and if that technology exists already for the claimed invention. This process is repeated twice with the examination spanning the entirety of the U.S. Patent archives (some 11 million patents).
If a model can be trained to determine the similarity between existing patents and new applications this would both reduce the number of man hours required by the patent office to do its job and also improve depth of patents examined during the search leading to better outcomes.

- **Wastewater Treatment Plant Upgrade:**

This report discusses a risk analysis conducted to determine best option to implement in order to upgrade a wastewater treatment plant’s septage receiving facilities. Within this report an influence diagram and decision tree were developed analyzing three different septage processing systems. Furthermore, various methods of analysis were conducted in order to examine the impact of different factors during the lifetime of the project had on the overall project decision. These factors pertained to qualities such as capital costs, schedule, and performance. Various methods of risk analysis were used to determine the impact these factors could have when considering the impact of perfect information, the probabilities of certain risks occurring, and the possible severities of these risks. This report discusses the objectives of the project in order to develop utilities and better aid in the decision-making process. Finally, upon the completion of this analysis a final decision was made determining the best option to build.

- **Weigh-In-Motion Stations:**

This final project will showcase the skills that I've developed while taking this class. I will be exploring a dataset made by the New York State Department of Transportation that contains traffic patterns of significant roads and highways in New York. I will be attempting to answer two research questions with the skills I've developed. One of those questions requires logistic analysis, and the methods I will be using to answer this question are Logistic Regression and a Classification Tree. The second question involves regression analysis, and the techniques I will be using to answer this question are Linear Regression and a Regression Tree. I will be using a variety of different visualizations and outputs to represent my process in answering these questions and displaying my results.

These projects highlight my expertise in various domains of data science, including database management, predictive modeling, natural language processing, and industrial optimization. Through my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate the breadth of my skills and the value I can bring to diverse data-driven challenges. I invite you to explore each project in detail and witness the tangible outcomes achieved through rigorous analysis, innovative methodologies, and a keen eye for extracting actionable insights.
